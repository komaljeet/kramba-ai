## EdgeHVN 83M — the measured PPL picture (2026-07-10)

The 83M has **three separate PPL/capability readings on three different data types** —
conflating them caused several wrong "ceiling" calls, so they're written down here:

| Data | PPL | What it measures | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Chat fine-tune (OpenAssistant)** | **~26.5–30** (low: 3.277 loss / 26.5 ppl, step 440) | conversational **fluency** — chat format, coherence | ✅ **solved & measured** |
| **Pretrain (SlimPajama web)** | ~110 → **63.5 val @ 50K (stopped)** | broad web **knowledge** | ⬇ descending — undertrained, not a wall |
| **Grounded reading** (`eval/grounded_qa.py`) | 50K probe: **0/5 closed, 1/5 open, +1 lift** | **read + recall** exact tokens from context | 🟡 partial grounding — the hybrid test |

**So 83M is conversational in the fluent-chat sense** — ppl ~30 on chat data is a real,
measured conversational model (that's why it responds to "hi" correctly). What it is **not**
is *knowledgeable* (ppl ~110 on web) or *grounded* (0/5 recall). The chatterbox is real and
quantified; the gaps are knowledge + reading, **not** fluency.

**The "~110 = 83M capacity ceiling" claim is REFUTED.** The old 10K-step run plateaued at
SlimPajama ~110, but that run was **data-capped at ~135M tokens** (the OASST
`max_repeat=3` bind) — it plateaued because it ran out of fresh data, not because 83M hit a
wall. The Chinchilla-floor pretrain (Muon, OASST dropped from pretrain) descended and went
below 110: val PPL 182 (step 2K) → 133 (4K) → 114 (6K) → **102.9 (8K)** → … → **63.45
(50K)**, descending on the asymptotic tail; train loss confirms (8.35 → 4.71 avg, with a
mid-run flat patch ~step 3K–5.5K that then **broke through and accelerated** ~step 6K–7.5K
— a phase transition, the opposite of a ceiling). **Do not draw capacity conclusions from a
PPL that is still descending** — the undertrained-vs-capacity question is OPEN, tilting
toward *undertrained*. The 50K grounded-QA probe (capability: can it *read*) is the
decisive test; the PPL trajectory is now a positive signal.

> **TODO:** The README's EdgeHVN picture still describes the Chinchilla-floor pretrain as
> "still descending" (bg `b2dytn9gk`) in one paragraph and "STOPPED at ~51K" in the next —
> those contradict. The settled truth is **STOPPED at ~51K** (see the 50K probe verdict
> below). Remove the "still descending / running" phrasing.

> **Why the current pretrain shows val_ppl ~103 while the old run reported "~37 overall":**
> a **mix change, not a regression.** The Chinchilla-floor pretrain deliberately dropped
> OASST from pretrain (`--pretrain-mix 0.85,0.0,0.15` — OASST belongs in chat-FT), so its
> val PPL is SlimPajama+Wiki only, with no easy chat data dragging it down. The old "~37
> overall" included 35% easy OASST. Apples-to-apples on the hard knowledge data: old ~110 →
> new ~103 and falling — the new run is *better* on knowledge.

**Note — "hi → unrelated/garbage text" is NOT a knowledge problem.** Knowledge is about
facts ("capital of France"); "hi" needs none. A model with perfect knowledge and a broken
decoder still emits garbage to "hi". Real causes: (1) **serving/decoding** — if EOS + the
chat-format turn marker aren't hard-enforced, generation runs past "hello" into
base-pretrain web continuation → "unrelated text" (no proper EdgeHVN decode path exists
yet; the Phase B `chat_edgehvn.py` entrypoint / EOS-50256 format is exactly this fix);
(2) **chat-FT too shallow** — only 640 steps / 3 epochs (noisy, bounced to ppl ~39), so the
base-pretrain web-text prior leaks through; (3) the **base pretrain itself emits web
garbage**. Fix = **serving-side EOS/format enforcement + a real chat-FT + a cleaner trunk** —
not more knowledge.

## 50K probe verdict + STOP decision (2026-07-11)

The Chinchilla pretrain reached ~step 51K (val PPL **63.45 @ 50K**, Slim 4.18 / Wiki `nan` —
the `nan` is the known cosmetic val-mislabel, not a training fault; train loss ~4.08, ~0.7
steps/s). The mid-run `eval/grounded_qa.py` probe on the 50K trunk: **closed-book 0/5,
open-book 1/5, retrieval lift +1/5 → "Partial grounding."** The single open-book hit (Q3,
boiling point) surfaced *"Celsius"* from the passage — passage-primed, not lucky (closed-book
for the same question was HTML garbage). vs the old undertrained base's **0/5 / 0/5 / +0**
(pure HTML garbage): the 50K trunk moved from "pure garbage" to "answer-shaped, weakly
passage-primed." **This leans undertrained, not capacity-limited** — the first signs of
reading appeared. **Caveat:** this is the *pure base, not chat-FT'd*, so closed-book is HTML
garbage regardless of knowledge; 1/5 is a "the pretrain is now alive enough to sometimes
ground" signal, not a clean capacity verdict.

**Decision: STOP the pretrain at ~51K** (process tree terminated 2026-07-11, GPU freed;
trunk preserved at
`checkpoints/edge_chinchilla83m/edge_conversational_step{50000,51000}.pt`). Rationale: the A5
gate is a *binary architectural recall test* (lift > 0 vs 0/5) — recall comes from the 2 new
attention layers, not trunk PPL — and the 50K trunk already reads (partial grounding), which
is the floor the hybrid A4 FT builds on. A stronger trunk (50K→100K, val 63→~40) is
asymptotic-tail (the big jump 110→63 already happened), **won't fix the no-chat-FT
closed-book confound**, and costs ~30 h of the one scarce GPU that the P0 (hybrid A4) needs
now. **Next: A4** short grounded continue-FT from this trunk → A5 gate.

## A5 gate result — hybrid A4 step5000 FAILED; re-FT on a bigger corpus (2026-07-12)

The A4 8K run (bg `bjblkgc53`) was killed at ~step 5920; latest surviving checkpoint
`hybrid_a4_step5000.pt`. Ran the A5 gate on it, plus a new **beyond-window probe**
(`eval/grounded_qa.py --far-probe`, MR !83) that shrinks the attention window and pushes
the passage past it, so only the DeltaNet recurrence — not the *windowed* attention — can
carry the answer. Both checkpoints, same gate:

| Checkpoint | standard: closed / open (lift) | far-probe W=128: closed / near / far |
|---|---|---|
| **pure trunk** `edge_conversational_step51000.pt` | 0/5 / 1/5 (**+1**) | 0/5 / **2/5** / **0/5** |
| **hybrid A4** `hybrid_a4_step5000.pt` | 1/5 / 0/5 (**−1**) | 2/5 / **0/5** / **0/5** |

**Verdict: the A4 FT made things WORSE, not better.** The hybrid at step5000 reads *less*
than the bare trunk (near-open 0/5 vs 2/5; open-book lift −1 vs +1). Cause = **data, not
steps or capacity**: the FT trained the 2 fresh attention layers on only **40** grounded
triples, so it memorised 40 pairs and degraded the trunk's weak reading instead of learning
the general skill. (Loss was still falling at kill, but on 40 examples more steps only
overfit harder.)

**Architectural finding from the far-probe (important — reframes the goal).** For BOTH
checkpoints, **far-open = 0/5, far-lift = 0**: the DeltaNet recurrence carries *zero exact
recall beyond the window*. And the 2 attention layers are *windowed*, so they cannot help
beyond the window either. Therefore the hybrid's achievable win is **exact recall WITHIN
the window** (the trunk's recurrence already got near-open 2/5 there; attention should push
that higher) — **not** beyond-window recall, which is architecturally capped at ~0 for both
the recurrence and windowed attention. Beyond the window, hybrid ≈ a plain sliding-window
transformer on exact recall; HVN's only beyond-window edge is a *lossy semantic gist* the
keyword gate can't credit. See [architecture.md](architecture.md).

## CORRECTION (2026-07-12, later) — the "made things WORSE" verdict above is RETRACTED

`grounded_qa`'s 5-item keyword gate is too noisy to trust for this decision — it gates a
1B-parameter scale-up call, and a 5-item test is dominated by luck (one keyword flips the
verdict) plus a real-world-knowledge/fluency confound unrelated to recall. Replaced it with
`eval/synthetic_recall_probe.py` (MR !83): hundreds of trials per checkpoint, INVENTED
entity/value pseudo-words (e.g. *"The Zorvex is called Blenthar."*) rendered in the model's
own trained chat/QA template — unambiguous exact-match scoring, zero real-world-knowledge
confound, in-distribution phrasing (an earlier raw-random-token-id version produced a flat
0% everywhere including inside the hybrid's own window — that was a format artifact, not a
recall measurement; retracted and fixed, see the script's docstring).

**Near-window exact-recall accuracy, 200 trials each:**

| Checkpoint | accuracy |
|---|---|
| pure trunk (`step51000`) | **4–5%** |
| old A4, 40-example corpus, "failed" (`hybrid_a4/step5000`) | **16–16.5%** |
| new A4, 5,240-example corpus (`hybrid_a4_v2/step5000`, only 63% through its run) | **35.5%** |

**The old 40-example FT was never a regression — it was already ~3-4x better than the trunk.**
The 5-item gate's −1 lift was noise, not signal. The corrected, high-N picture is a clean,
monotonic trend: bigger grounded-QA corpus → better recall, exactly as hypothesized, and the
new run isn't even finished. **Beyond-window** (target pushed >W=128 via 16 distractor facts):
trunk 0.5%, old A4 0.5% (both = noise floor), **new A4 5.5%** — the first checkpoint to show
signal clearly above floor, though still far below the near-window number; worth watching at
step8000, not yet a strong claim.

**`eval/synthetic_recall_probe.py` is now the primary R&D gate; `grounded_qa.py` (standard +
`--far-probe`) is secondary — useful for real-world-transfer sanity, not for this go/no-go.**
